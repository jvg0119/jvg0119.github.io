Life is full of challenges. Web development has lots of challenges it all depends on what level you are in. So, your greatest challenges are going to change as you grow in this profession.

_As an aspiring and new web developer in the early stage of my learning to code one of the biggest challenge I came across so far is:_   

__Overwhelming amount of information to learn__  
In the beginning, you start out like a sponge soaking everything. There was so much to learn ruby variables and arrays, if statements, for and while loops. It was a lot of fun! And after you start learning some of the basics you start putting things together like making simple logic or maybe putting together a simple app following some tutorial. Then you learn about rails basics and so forth. And soon you start going into the deeper waters and start trying more new things. Soon you start to plateau where it doesn't feel like you're advancing much but there seems to me more and more new things that you need to learn. Where does it stop!  

After a while, starting out without any real background in programming (or probably even with a little knowledge) felt like being lost in the middle of the ocean in the middle of the night. You just keep moving and trying and not giving up. Soon you find some kind of direction maybe from the stars and moon orientation. When the sun comes up you'll feel a little better because at least now you can see more. Along your way  you may find something to comfort you like food or another boat far away or maybe even a small island. And the story goes on and on and on. And it doesn't end because programming goes on and so does life.

I think the key is not to give up and when the going gets tough you just keep going. What doesn't kill you will make you stronger. But that's not where it end. Every time you struggle and you beat it the feeling of accomplishment is just the opposite. The fruits of your hard work are just as rewarding and wonderful!

So, keep at it and never give up. Thanks for reading my post.
